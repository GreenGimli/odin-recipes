# odin-recipes
A place for all my favorite recipes!
This is my first major coding project for The Odin Project. I will be creating a website to showcase a few of my favorite recipes. Once I've completed this project, I'll have demonstrated some key skills, including sending git commits to GitHub, utilizing HTML boilerplate, links, images, and lists--just to name a few!
