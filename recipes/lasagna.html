            <li>1 pound bulk Italina sausage</li>
            <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 pinch basil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried sage</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried onion flakes</li>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) jars marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Stir in the water and black olives, and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes.</li>
            <li>Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Stir in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Cover with a layer of dry noodles.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>over with another layer of sauce, and repeat layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife into it.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and return to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice melted cheese topping.</li>
        </ol>
